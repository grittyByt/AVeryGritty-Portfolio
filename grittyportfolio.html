                    Hello all!  My name is Terrell otherwise online in gitHub I go by grittyByt.  I got introduced to coding due to my love of art and enjoyment of creating.  I'm self-taught for the last 4yrs and decided I would enroll into a coding bootcamp so I can learn real-world coding tactics; as well as best team practices when it comes to designing a web application.  Formely I've served for years in the Marines across seas, and for the past 8 years I've worked as an HVAC Technician all over Georgia.  Due to where our society is heading with technology and web applications I decided to make a sharp pivot by giving coding my full attention.  With hopes of creating, designing, and ultimately mastering various computer languages so I can create my own piece of online estate that I want to bring into existence and share with the world.  Coding to me is a chance to change not only my life, but the family I carry in my arms so that their futures are filled with even more opportunities than I ever imagined today.
